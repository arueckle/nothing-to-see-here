# A short description of this adapter.
description: |
  Adapter trained with the houlsby adapter architecture with a reduction factor of 2 and a gelu activation function.
  The invertible adapter is also trained with a reduction factor of 2 and a gelu activation function.
  The adapter was trained for 250k steps and a batch size of 64 on english wikipedia text.
